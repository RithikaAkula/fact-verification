The asteroid is a member of the Flora family , a large group of stony S-type asteroids in the inner main-belt . It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8 -- 2.6 AU once every 3 years and 3 months 1,203 days . Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 2 ° with respect to the ecliptic . First identified as at Johannesburg , the body 's first used observation was taken at Nice Observatory in 1943 , when Dobrovolsky was identified as , extending its observation arc by 23 years prior to its official discovery observation . The so-far best rated rotational light-curve of Dobrovolsky was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Brian A. Skiff in March 2011 . It gave a rotation period of 4.812 hours with a brightness variation of 0.13 magnitude .
